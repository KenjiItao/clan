## One-trait model
We build a simple model of family groups, in which exchange of brides and resultant cooperation and competition are considered, by applying an agent-based model and multi-level evolution. By introducing one dimensional trait and preference, we show the emergence of the incest taboo.

Run [one-trait/emergy.py](one-trait/emerge.py) to get the phase diagrams on the emergence of the incest taboo.  
Run [one-trait/plot.py](one-trait/plot.py) to get the visual images on the emergence of the incest taboo.

## Two-trait model
By introducing two dimensional trait and preference, we show the emergence of kinship structures.

Run [two-trait/emergy.py](two-trait/emerge.py) to get the phase diagrams on the emergence of kinship structures.  
Run [two-trait/plot.py](two-trait/plot.py) to get the visual images on the emergence of kinship structures.
