## One-trait model
We build a simple model of family groups, in which exchange of brides and resultant cooperation and competition are considered, by applying an agent-based model and multi-level evolution. By introducing one dimensional trait and preference, we show the emergence of the incest taboo.

Run [one-trait/emergy.py](one-trait/emerge.py) to get the phase diagrams on the emergence of the incest taboo.  
Run [one-trait/plot.py](one-trait/plot.py) to get the visual images on the emergence of the incest taboo.

## Two-trait model
By introducing two dimensional trait and preference, we show the emergence of kinship structures.

Run [two-trait/emergy.py](two-trait/emerge.py) to get the phase diagrams on the emergence of kinship structures.  
Run [two-trait/plot.py](two-trait/plot.py) to get the visual images on the emergence of kinship structures.

## Revised model
We simplify the two-traiit model and discuss the evolution of kinship structures and descent systems.

Run [revised/structure.py](revised/structure.py) for the simulation.

## Empirical data analyses
Data analyses using global ethnographic database, the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample are conducted.
See [data_analysis](data_analysis) for details.
