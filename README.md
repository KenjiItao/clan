Source Code of K. Itao and K. Kaneko "Evolution of Kinship Structures Driven by Marriage Tie and Competition" (to be published)

## One-trait model
We build a simple model of family groups, in which exchange of brides and resultant cooperation and competition are considered, by applying an agent-based model and multi-level evolution.
